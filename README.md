# Final-Project
# Wine Quality Predicter

The goal of this project was to explore the possibility of predicting wine quality using chemical characteristics and machine learning.

## DATA
All wine in our dataset were labeled with a quality rating from 1-10 and the  
Used class example as a frame to start work. 
Created two machine learning models for red and white wine. Using random forest and learner regression. It was found that random forest fulfilled the projectâ€™s needs much better. The ability to record inputting data to grow the model data base was disabled as it could erupt the overall profile of the original model data.
Tableau was used to analyze for trends within the data.
Flask was used to bring the information together. HTML was used to create the displays. 
AWS was used to publish the site.
